This is basically hosted through a web browser with no web server -
once node.js has been activated then we are using a web server to host it so you can connect a database
and do other fancy stuff. So you can do more backend stuff , where if you just use a webbrowser it can'then
it can't do certain things. 

If you have a web application hosted via a server, if the server is down then you can't access 
the webpage, where as previsouly we were rending html directly to the webbrowser.
