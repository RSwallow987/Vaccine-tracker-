/*
Testing smart contracts is very important because you need to make sure that they work perfectly before going live on the blockchain.
Truffle uses the Mocha testing framework and Chai for assertions to provide you with a solid framework from which to write your JavaScript tests.
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, 
making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, 
while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub.
The describe call is what gives structure to your test suite i.e. logically group your tests
i.e. `describe()` is merely for grouping
The it call identifies each individual tests but by itself it does not tell Mocha anything about how your test suite is structured. 
i.e. `it()` is a test case
`before()`, `beforeEach()`, `after()`, `afterEach()` are hooks to run before/after first/each it() or describe().
